# PHASE 6, IMPROVEMENT 1: Fee Settings Simplification

**Date Completed**: 2026-06-05  
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Coding Agent) + User (sune)  
**Status**: `COMPLETED — APPROVED`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The system previously used two separate tables to store fee configuration:

| Table | Role | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| `program_general_fees` | Wide table for core academic rates (tuition, RLE) | Required complex fallback SQL to find the right row per term |
| `program_specific_fees` | EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) rows for misc/other fees | Aggregation required a correlated `NOT EXISTS` anti-join; hard to read, hard to update |

**The consequence**: Every service that needed to calculate a student's fees (`ScholarEnrollmentService`, readiness checks, etc.) had to replicate multi-dozen-line raw JDBC queries with nested subqueries. The logic was duplicated, fragile, and untestable.

### User's Original Request
> "I figured since we are setting this fee per term per year per semester, we can unify it to a single table... 0 means it is not required for the program and will not display, value detected means it is required and will be displayed and computed."

---

## 2. Design Decisions

### Decision A — No `studentledger_id` in This Table

**User asked**: Should the ledger ID be tagged in this table?  
**Decision**: No. Approved by user.

**Rationale**:  
This table is a **template**, not a transaction. It defines *rules* (e.g., "All Year 1 BSIT students in Term 10 pay ₱1,500 tuition per unit"). The `student_ledger` is *transactional* — it records what an individual student actually owes.

If ledger IDs were embedded here, every fee setting row would be duplicated per student, completely destroying the template concept and introducing a 1:1 join that is both logically wrong and a database footprint multiplier.

**Correct Flow**:
```
[program_fee_settings] ──(read at enrollment)──▶ [student_ledger] ──(billing)──▶ [student]
```

### Decision B — Wide Table vs. EAV

**User asked**: Is the rigidity of a wide table acceptable?  
**Decision**: Wide table. Approved by user.

**Rationale**:

| Criteria | EAV (old) | Wide Table (new) |
|---|---|---|
| Query complexity | High (correlated anti-join) | Minimal (`SELECT * ... LIMIT 1`) |
| Adding a new fee type | One `INSERT` row | `ALTER TABLE` + code update |
| DB row count | Grows per fee type × per scope | Fixed: one row per scope |
| Type safety | None (all stored as `VARCHAR` or `DECIMAL`) | Explicit `DECIMAL(10,2)` per column |
| Readability | Low | High |

For this system, the university's fee *types* are relatively stable and fixed. The trade-off of requiring a schema migration to add a new fee type is far outweighed by the massive reduction in query complexity and maintenance burden.

**Maximum row estimate**: ~20 programs × 4 year levels × 2 semesters = **160 rows max**. No overload risk.

---

## 3. Final Schema

### `program_fee_settings` (New Unified Table)

```sql
CREATE TABLE program_fee_settings (
    fee_setting_id       INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

    -- Scope / Key
    program_id           INT NOT NULL,
    term_id              INT NULL,          -- NULL = fallback template for all terms
    year_level           INT NULL,          -- 1..4
    semester_number      INT NULL,          -- 1 or 2

    -- Core Per-Unit Academic Rates
    fee_tuition_per_unit  DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_lec_per_unit      DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,  -- often mirrors tuition
    fee_lab_per_unit      DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_comp_per_unit     DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_rle_per_unit      DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,  -- BSN/clinical programs only

    -- Flat Miscellaneous Charges
    fee_misc_registration DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_misc_library      DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_misc_medical      DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_misc_id           DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_misc_athletic     DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,

    -- Other Flat Charges
    fee_other_late_enrollment DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_other_add_drop        DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    fee_other_installment     DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,

    is_active            TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);
```

**Semantics**:
- A column value of `0.00` means the fee does not apply for this scope and will not be displayed or computed.
- A column value `> 0` means the fee applies and will be shown and computed against the student's enrolled units or as a flat charge.
- `term_id = NULL` creates a **fallback template** — the fee rates that apply when no specific term override exists.
- `term_id = <id>` creates a **term-specific override** — the exact fee rates for that particular academic term.

---

## 4. Fallback Resolution Logic

The system uses a **priority-ordered single query** to resolve fees. The rule is:

> **Exact term match wins over fallback. Most recent entry wins on ties.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM program_fee_settings
WHERE program_id = ?
  AND year_level = ?
  AND semester_number = ?
  AND is_active = 1
  AND (term_id = ? OR term_id IS NULL)
ORDER BY
  CASE WHEN term_id = ? THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,  -- exact term = priority 0, fallback = priority 1
  fee_setting_id DESC                         -- latest entry wins on ties
LIMIT 1
```

### Visual Example

```
Setup:
  Row A: program=BSIT, term=NULL,  year=1, sem=1, tuition=1500  ← fallback
  Row B: program=BSIT, term=10,    year=1, sem=1, tuition=1600  ← term override

Query: "What does BSIT Y1S1 pay in Term 10?"
  → Finds Row B (exact match) → tuition = 1600

Query: "What does BSIT Y1S1 pay in Term 11 (no config yet)?"
  → Finds Row A (fallback)    → tuition = 1500
```

## 5. Code Architecture

### 5.1 — `ProgramFeeSetting.java` (JPA Entity)
**Package**: `com.iuims.registrar.finance`  
**File**: `src/main/java/com/iuims/registrar/finance/ProgramFeeSetting.java`

- Maps to `program_fee_settings` table.
- Each fee type is a `BigDecimal` field (precision 10, scale 2).
- Provides `getFee(String feeCode)` and `setFee(String feeCode, double amount)` for generic, code-driven access. This is critical — it allows the service layer to iterate over `KNOWN_FEES` without needing to reflect on individual fields.
- Supports two aliases: `RLE_RATE_PER_HOUR` and `RLE_FEE_PER_UNIT` both map to `feeRlePerUnit` for backward compatibility.

### 5.2 — `ProgramFeeSettingRepository.java` (Spring Data JPA Repository)
**Package**: `com.iuims.registrar.finance`  
**File**: `src/main/java/com/iuims/registrar/finance/ProgramFeeSettingRepository.java`

Two key query methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `findBestMatch(programId, yearLevel, semester, termId)` | Read path — resolves the best applicable fee setting, exact or fallback. |
| `findActiveForScopeOrFallback(programId, yearLevel, semester, termId)` | Write path — checks before creating a new row to avoid orphan duplicates. |

Both use the same priority-ordered `CASE WHEN` native SQL query (see Section 4).

### 5.3 — `TermFeeAdminService.java` (Refactored)
**Package**: `com.iuims.registrar.finance`  
**File**: `src/main/java/com/iuims/registrar/finance/TermFeeAdminService.java`

**Key public methods**:

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `getFeeRatesForScope(programId, termId, yearLevel, semester)` | Returns `Map<String, Double>` of all fee codes with non-zero values for the scope |
| `getFeeRateSourcesForScope(...)` | Same, but returns `Map<String, String>` indicating `"EXACT_TERM"` or `"FALLBACK"` per code — used by the admin UI to display fallback warnings |
| `saveFeeRate(programId, termId, yearLevel, semester, feeCode, amount)` | Upserts a fee value. If no exact-term row exists, creates one (copying from fallback if present). If `TUITION_PER_UNIT` is set and `LEC_FEE_PER_UNIT` is 0, it auto-mirrors the tuition value to lec. |
| `prepareTermFees(termId)` | For all programs and scopes, seeds exact-term rows from fallback templates if none exist. Admin-triggered. |
| `copyImportedProgramFeeTemplates(termId)` | Seeds fee settings for "derived" programs (e.g., BSBAFIN copies from BSBA) using a defined source map. |
| `buildTermReadinessSummary(termId)` | Produces a full diagnostic of which scopes are missing fees, which are on fallback, and whether the term is ready. |

**Static fee code registry** (`KNOWN_FEES` list):
```
TUITION_PER_UNIT, LEC_FEE_PER_UNIT, LAB_FEE_PER_UNIT, COMP_FEE_PER_UNIT, RLE_FEE_PER_UNIT,
MISC_REGISTRATION, MISC_LIBRARY, MISC_MEDICAL, MISC_ID, MISC_ATHLETIC,
OTHER_LATE_ENROLLMENT, OTHER_ADD_DROP, OTHER_INSTALLMENT
```

### 5.4 — `ScholarEnrollmentService.java` (Refactored)
**Package**: `com.iuims.registrar.scholarship`  
**File**: `src/main/java/com/iuims/registrar/scholarship/ScholarEnrollmentService.java`

**Before**: Contained two private methods (`coreTuitionRate`, `coreFeeSum`) that executed their own raw JDBC queries against the old split tables. This duplicated the fallback logic from `TermFeeAdminService` and violated the encapsulation boundary.

**After**: Both methods now delegate to `TermFeeAdminService.getFeeRatesForScope(...)`.

```java
// Before (duplicated 50+ lines of raw JDBC):
private double coreTuitionRate(Integer programId, ...) { /* raw SQL */ }

// After (single delegating call):
private double coreTuitionRate(Integer programId, Integer termId, int yearLevel, int semester) {
    Map<String, Double> rates = termFeeAdminService.getFeeRatesForScope(programId, termId, yearLevel, semester);
    return rates.getOrDefault("TUITION_PER_UNIT", 0.0);
}
```

`TermFeeAdminService` is injected via **constructor injection** to comply with Spring Modulith's architectural boundary rules (no field injection across module boundaries).

### 5.5 — `TermFeeAdminController.java` (Unchanged)
The HTTP controller was not modified. It continues to receive the same `Map<String, Double>` and `Map<String, String>` structures from the service layer, meaning there is **zero frontend breakage** from this backend overhaul.

---

## 6. Old Tables — Migration & Deprecation

The old `program_general_fees` and `program_specific_fees` tables are **no longer read or written to** by any service. They remain in the database for now (data migration buffer period) but are considered deprecated.

> **Action Required (Future)**: Once data from the old tables has been migrated to `program_fee_settings` and verified, a DBA should drop `program_general_fees` and `program_specific_fees`.

Data migration script needed:
```sql
-- Migrate core general fees into program_fee_settings
INSERT INTO program_fee_settings
    (program_id, term_id, year_level, semester_number,
     fee_tuition_per_unit, fee_rle_per_unit, is_active)
SELECT
    program_id, term_id, year_level, semester_number,
    tuition_per_unit, rle_fee_per_unit, is_active
FROM program_general_fees
WHERE is_active = 1
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    fee_tuition_per_unit = VALUES(fee_tuition_per_unit),
    fee_rle_per_unit     = VALUES(fee_rle_per_unit);

-- Migrate specific fees (MISC group) — example for known codes
UPDATE program_fee_settings pfs
JOIN program_specific_fees psf
    ON pfs.program_id = psf.program_id
   AND pfs.year_level = psf.year_level
   AND pfs.semester_number = psf.semester_number
   AND (pfs.term_id = psf.term_id OR (pfs.term_id IS NULL AND psf.term_id IS NULL))
SET
    pfs.fee_misc_registration = IF(psf.fee_code = 'REGISTRATION', psf.amount, pfs.fee_misc_registration),
    pfs.fee_misc_library      = IF(psf.fee_code = 'LIBRARY',      psf.amount, pfs.fee_misc_library)
    -- ... etc
WHERE psf.is_active = 1;
```

---

## 7. Test Coverage

### `TermFeeAdminServiceTest`
**Class**: `com.iuims.registrar.finance.TermFeeAdminServiceTest`  
**Type**: `@DataJpaTest` (H2 in-memory, MySQL mode)

| Test | Verifies |
|---|---|
| `saveFeeRate_createsNewFallbackSetting` | A save to a new scope creates the row and reads back correctly |
| `exactTermFeeWinsOverFallback` | Exact term row is returned over fallback when both exist |
| `fallbackFeeSourcesCorrectly` | Source map returns `"FALLBACK"` when no exact term row exists |

### `AcademicGradingServiceTermTransitionTest`
Updated to use `program_fee_settings` schema in H2 setup — previously seeded `program_general_fees` directly.

### `GradeOutcomeSemanticsTest`
Updated constructor call to include the new `TermFeeAdminService` argument.

### `ModulithTests`
Passes fully — verifies there are no circular dependencies and no field injection across module boundaries.

## 8. Lessons Learned / Design Notes for Future Agents

1. **The `KNOWN_FEES` list is the registry.** Any code that iterates over fee types uses this constant. If a new fee column is ever added to the DB schema, `KNOWN_FEES` in `TermFeeAdminService` must be updated, as must `getFee()`/`setFee()` in `ProgramFeeSetting`, and the DDL.

2. **Do not add fee queries in other services.** All fee reads must go through `TermFeeAdminService.getFeeRatesForScope()`. Any service that directly queries `program_fee_settings` is violating the encapsulation and will duplicate fallback logic.

3. **Fallback (term_id = NULL) is the template. Exact rows override it.** Never delete fallback rows — they are the base. Override rows are created per term as admin prepares each semester.

4. **`saveFeeRate` has a side effect**: if `TUITION_PER_UNIT` is being set and `LEC_FEE_PER_UNIT` is still zero, it auto-mirrors the tuition value to the lecture fee. This is intentional — most programs bill the same rate for both, and admin should only need to override lecture if it differs.

# PHASE 6, IMPROVEMENT 2: Explicit Term-to-Term Fee Imports

**Date Completed**: 2026-06-05  
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Coding Agent) + User (sune)  
**Status**: `COMPLETED — APPROVED`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Administrators needed a way to explicitly automate the process of copying fee configurations from a previous academic term to a new term. This eliminates manual data entry while giving the administrator complete control over *when* the import happens and *which* term serves as the source.

## 2. Design Decisions

Because of the migration to the unified wide-table architecture (`program_fee_settings`), the database intrinsically acts as a backup. Every fee template is hard-linked to a specific `term_id`. When a new term starts, the old term's fees are safely preserved.

We simply needed to provide an interface that reads from the `sourceTermId` and duplicates those rows into the `targetTermId`.

## 3. Implementation

- **Data Access**: Added `findByTermIdAndIsActiveTrue` and `findByProgramIdAndYearLevelAndSemesterNumberAndTermId` to `ProgramFeeSettingRepository.java`.
- **Business Logic**: Implemented `importFeesFromSpecificTerm` in `TermFeeAdminService.java` which iterates through all rows of the source term, checks for existing target rows, and either creates or updates them using the `KNOWN_FEES` registry.
- **Controller Endpoint**: Exposed `@PostMapping("/import-from-term")` in `TermFeeAdminController.java`.

# PHASE 6, IMPROVEMENT 3: Fresh Database Verification

**Date Completed**: 2026-06-05  
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Coding Agent) + User (sune)  
**Status**: `COMPLETED — APPROVED`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

To rigorously test the new `program_fee_settings` business logic and prove that the application no longer has any hidden dependencies on the deprecated legacy EAV tables, we needed to run the system on a fresh database.

## 2. Execution

1. **Schema Cloning & Eradication**: Exported the schema of the `eacdb` database. Manually dropped `program_general_fees` and `program_specific_fees` from the schema.
2. **Fresh DB Creation**: Created a new `eacdb_fresh` database and imported the purified schema along with lookup tables (`programs`, `academic_terms`).
3. **Integration Testing**: Created a Spring Boot Integration Test (`TermFeeFreshDatabaseIntegrationTest.java`) explicitly wired to `eacdb_fresh` instead of the default H2 database.
4. **Validation**: The test successfully seeded fallback templates, prepared a term, and executed an explicit term-to-term import, passing with zero legacy table dependencies.

# PHASE 6, IMPROVEMENT 4: Term Fee UX Locks and Scoped Imports

**Date Completed**: 2026-06-05  
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Coding Agent) + User (sune)  
**Status**: `COMPLETED — APPROVED`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Two usability issues were identified after completing the initial Explicit Term Imports:
1. **Contradictory State Risk**: Admins could select an Academic Term (e.g., "A.Y. 2025-2026 2nd Semester") from a dropdown, but could simultaneously select an opposing Semester (e.g., "1st") from a separate dropdown. This created illogical "1st semester subjects in a 2nd semester calendar term" mapping configurations.
2. **Import Granularity**: The explicit term import was a blunt "all-or-nothing" instrument. Admins needed the ability to surgically import fees for *just* a specific Program/Year, while retaining the ability to bulk-import the entire university.

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 Dynamic Semester Toggle
- **UI Logic**: We modified `admin_term_fees.html`. The `<select>` options for Academic Terms were injected with a `data-semester` HTML5 attribute.
- **Lock Mechanism**: Using vanilla JS, when a specific calendar term is selected, the Semester dropdown instantly snaps to match the actual semester of the term, and the `disabled` property is applied. 
- **Global Fallback Unlocking**: We explicitly added a `-- Global Fallback Templates --` option (representing `term_id = -1`). Selecting this instantly unlocks the Semester toggle, acknowledging that Global Fallbacks are calendar-agnostic.

### 2.2 Scoped vs. Bulk Imports
- **Backend**: We added a scoped query to `ProgramFeeSettingRepository` (`findByTermIdAndProgramIdAndYearLevelAndSemesterNumberAndIsActiveTrue`) and refactored `TermFeeAdminService.importFeesFromSpecificTerm` to conditionally use this targeted query if `programId`, `yearLevel`, and `semester` are provided.
- **Frontend Override**: The UI "Import from Source" button now defaults to a targeted import (using whatever filters the admin currently has active on the screen). We added a checkbox `[x] Bulk import for ALL programs & years`. If checked, the HTML form injects `importScope=all`, signaling the controller to pass `null` for the scoping variables, triggering the classic full-university mass import override.

# PHASE 6, IMPROVEMENT 5: Subsystem Scope Reduction

**Date Completed**: 2026-06-05  
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Coding Agent) + User (sune)  
**Status**: `COMPLETED — APPROVED`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The Registrar subsystem previously contained dead code and UI elements for features that are no longer handled by this domain:
1. **Basic Education**: High School, Junior High, and Senior High program codes were cluttering the rosters and course offerings. This system only manages College students.
2. **Payments**: The Registrar dashboard was capturing internal payment flows, which have now been deprecated in favor of an external Open Enrollment / Cashier Gateway.

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 Basic Education Filtering
- **Backend Logic**: Updated `JaypeeIntegrationService.java` and `AcademicGradingService.java` to aggressively filter out all basic education records. Added explicit WHERE clauses `p.program_code NOT IN ('HS', 'JHS', 'SHS')` to all native queries and JPA filters.
- **UI Impact**: Removed Basic Ed options from dropdowns in `admin_classes.html` and `dashboard.html`. The roster now exclusively displays college programs, courses, and classes.

### 2.2 Payment Gateway Delegation
- **Deprecation**: Stripped the internal payment capture views and logics. The Registrar subsystem's responsibility is strictly to **set** fees (`/admin/term-fees`), not collect them.
- **External Redirect**: Rewired the `admin_student_manager.html` to direct financial transactions via an `Open Enrollment System (External)` button, pointing seamlessly to the external gateway URL configured in the backend model.

# PHASE 7: Premium UI Standardization

**Date Completed**: 2026-06-05  
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Coding Agent) + User (sune)  
**Status**: `COMPLETED — APPROVED`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Following the massive `theme-eac.css` layout update on the Dashboard and Term Fees pages, several legacy pages remained stuck in an older design era. They lacked sidebars, used outdated Bootstrap tables, and suffered from nested `<head>` tags breaking the layout wrappers.

## 2. Execution

We meticulously migrated all remaining pages to strictly adhere to the new premium `.app > .body-wrapper > .main` architecture:

1. **User Management (`/admin/users`)**: 
   - Replaced legacy Bootstrap modals with native HTML5 `<dialog>` tags.
   - Restyled the System Users table with `table-eac` spacing, modern pill badges, and aligned action buttons.
   - Fixed a strict SpEL typing issue where `u.is_active` (Integer) threw 500 errors when evaluated as a raw boolean.
2. **Classes (`/admin/classes`)**: 
   - Refactored the Curriculum Offerings view. Added sleek filter pills and properly formatted the search bar to match the new visual identity.
3. **Legacy Template Repairs**: 
   - Pages like `admin_settings.html`, `admin_scholarships.html`, `admin_approvals.html`, and `admin_admission_acceptance.html` were repaired by replacing malformed nested `<th:block th:replace="~{fragments/layout :: head}">` injections with the proper root `<head th:replace="~{fragments/layout :: head}">` inclusion.
   - Fixed the `class_schedules` backend entity mapping bug that previously crashed the Approvals page.

The entire Registrar portal now boasts a cohesive, high-end, premium aesthetic across all routes.
